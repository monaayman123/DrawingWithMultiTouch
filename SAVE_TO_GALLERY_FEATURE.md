# Save to Gallery Feature

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the "Save to Gallery" functionality for the DrawingWithMultiTouch app.

## Problem Statement
When users tap "Save", they want to save their drawing to the phone's gallery/photos app, not just to internal app files.

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

1. **Updated `SaveImageInGallery.kt`**:
   - Replaced internal file storage with MediaStore API for gallery saving
   - Added version-specific handling for Android 10+ (API 29+) vs older versions
   - For Android 10+: Uses scoped storage with MediaStore.Images.Media
   - For older Android: Uses external storage with MediaStore notifications

2. **Updated `MainActivity.kt`**:
   - Added timestamp to image names for uniqueness (`drawing_1234567890.png`)
   - Added error handling with try-catch block
   - Added logging for debugging save failures

### How It Works

#### Android 10+ (API 29+)
- Uses `MediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI`
- Images saved to `Pictures` directory automatically
- No special permissions required due to scoped storage
- MediaStore handles gallery integration automatically

#### Android 9 and below (API 28-)
- Uses `Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES)`
- Requires `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission (already in manifest)
- Manually inserts into MediaStore for gallery visibility
- Falls back to FileProvider if MediaStore insertion fails

### User Experience
1. User draws on canvas
2. User taps "Save" button
3. Image is saved to phone's gallery with unique filename
4. Gallery app opens showing the saved image
5. Image appears in Photos/Gallery app for future access

### Technical Details
- Images saved as PNG format with 100% quality
- Unique filenames prevent overwrites: `drawing_[timestamp].png`
- Error handling prevents app crashes on save failures
- Cross-platform compatibility for all Android versions (API 24+)

### Testing
To test this feature:
1. Install and run the app
2. Draw something on the canvas
3. Tap the "Save" button
4. Verify the gallery app opens showing your drawing
5. Check the Photos/Gallery app to confirm the image is permanently saved
